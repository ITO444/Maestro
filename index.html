            <hr/>
            <p> <strong>What is a convolutional neural network?</strong> </p> 
<br/>
<p>A class of deep, feed-forward artificial neural networks. Different from over neural networks, the convolutional neural network (CNN) employs the convolutional function in the convolution layer, along with pooling and fully connected layers. Taking inspiration from biological processes of the animal visual cortex, the CNN is a type of neural network proven to be very successful in image recognition tasks.</p>
<br/>
            <p> <strong>What do I input to the convolutional neural network</strong> </p> 
<br/>
<p>Prometheus takes jpeg images as input from users. We then turn the image into a 3D numpy array, resize and normalize the data, and then save the jpeg file to an hdf5 file "testing_data".</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>What is the output of the convolutional neural network?</strong></p>
<br/>
<p>The convolutional neural network calculates and outputs in the probability (denoted by y-hat) of the inputted mole image being malignant melanoma.</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>How accurate is the convolutional neural network's calculation?</strong></p>
<br/>
<p>Due to time constraints, we have not been able to perfect our convolutional neural network model. However, our convolutional neural network has been estimated to perform medical diagnosis with above 70% accuracy, which rivals that of professional diagnosticians.</p>
<p><strong>How can I get involved in this project?</strong></p>
<br/>
<p>Developers, melanoma ptients, and users alike are all welcome to contribute to the Prometheus project. Interested developers may refer to the Github repository (https://github.com/chinglamchoi/Prometheus), where all convolutional neural network and Prometheus app protoype files are available open source. Melanoma ptients can contribute to the cause by submitting images of medically diagnosed melanoma moles, which can effectively enhance our melanoma dataset. Users can contribute by submitting mole images via the "Detect Melanoma" button, which helps Prometheus developers better assess the accuracy of our CNN.</p>

            <hr/>
            <p> <strong>What is Melanoma?</strong> </p> 
<br/>
<p>A type of skin cacer that develops from pigment-containing cells known as melanocytes. Melanoma typically occurs in the skin, but is sometimes found in the mouth, intestines, or eye.</p>
<br/>
            <p> <strong>What causes Melanoma?</strong> </p> 
<br/>
<p>Melanomas are usually caused by DNA damage as a result of exposure to solar UV light, or other UV radiation sources usch as tanning devices. Genetics, strength of immune system, number of moles one already has are all factors of one's risk of being diagnosed for melanoma.</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>What are some symptoms of Melanoma?</strong></p>
<br/>
<p>Melanoma symptoms are often abbreviated to "ABCDE". "A" refers to asymmetry in moles, "B" referring to irregular moles borders, "C" referring to uneven mole colour distribution, "D" referring to moles with diameters of above 6 mm, and "E" referring to how the mole evolves with time.</p>
<br/>
<p><strong>How can I prevent contracting Melanoma?</strong></p>
<br/>
<p>As genetics and local climate both play a role in causing melanoma, it is impossible to guarantee being free of melanoma. However, one can lower their risks of contracting through exercising habits such as wearing sunscreen, protective clothing against intense solar UV light, avoiding excessive tanning. It is also crucial to recognise the significance of regular check ups, especially when suspicious looking moles that satisy the melanoma "ABCDE" rule form. </p>
<p><strong>I have melanoma, what do I do?</strong></p>
<br/>
<p>Unlike particular forms of cancer, melanoma skin cancer has a decent 5 yer survival rate, especially when detected at very early stages. If  diagnosed with melanoma, you should cooperate with your doctor in eradicating the risk of melanoma metastasizing through tissue, the lymph system and the blood. Depending on the stage of the melanoma found, treatment methods differ from surgery (for stages 0 till 3), to clinical trials (stages 1 till 3), to chemotherapy (stage 4). In terms of post-diagnosis treatment, good communication and cooperation with your doctor is key to making a full recovery. In case you would like to verify your medical diagnosis of melanoma, you may gain a second opinion via the "Detect melanoma" button on the Prometheus app.</p>
